My assignment for week 5 day 3 



1. What is TensorFlow, and what are its key features?

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google for building and training deep learning models.

Key features:

Efficient computation using dataflow graphs

Supports CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs for scalable performance

Built-in Keras API for easy model building

TensorBoard for model visualization

Deployment support (mobile, web, cloud)



---

2. What is the main difference between TensorFlow and PyTorch in terms of computation graphs?

TensorFlow uses static computation graphs (Graphs are defined before execution).

PyTorch uses dynamic computation graphs (Graphs are built on-the-fly during execution).


This makes PyTorch more intuitive and flexible, while TensorFlow is more optimized for production.


---

3. What is Keras, and on which frameworks can it run?

Keras is a high-level deep learning API designed for ease of use.

It can run on:

TensorFlow (default backend)

Theano

Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) (older versions)



---

4. What are the key features of Scikit-learn?

Scikit-learn is a machine learning library in Python used for traditional ML tasks.

Key features:

Supervised learning (e.g., SVM, Decision Trees)

Unsupervised learning (e.g., K-Means, PCA)

Feature selection and preprocessing

Model evaluation and tuning



---

5. What is the purpose of Jupyter Notebooks, and what are its key features?

Jupyter Notebooks are an interactive coding environment used for data science and ML.

Key features:

Supports multiple languages (Python, R, Julia)

Live code execution with markdown documentation

Supports visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn

Easy sharing and collaboration

6. In the TensorFlow example provided, what is the purpose of the Dropout layer in the neural network?

The Dropout layer helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping a fraction of neurons during training, ensuring the model generalizes better to new data.


---

7. What is the role of the optimizer in the PyTorch example, and which optimizer is used?

The optimizer updates the modelâ€™s weights to minimize loss during training.

The commonly used optimizer in PyTorch is Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation), which combines momentum and adaptive learning rates for efficient training.


---

8. In the Keras example, what is the purpose of the Conv2D layer?

The Conv2D layer is used in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for extracting spatial features from images, such as edges and textures.


---

9. What type of model is used in the Scikit-learn example, and what dataset is it applied to?

The Scikit-learn example likely uses a classification model (e.g., Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression) applied to a common dataset like Iris or Digits dataset.


---

10. What is the output of the Jupyter Notebook example, and which library is used to generate the visualization?

The output is likely a graph or plot, and the library used is typically Matplotlib or Seaborn for data visualization.
